Curious huh? Okay... This is the configuration file, automatically generated. Well, almost automatically, I have written this text myself. Anyway, I have one !!!WARNING!!! for you, here it goes:

>>Do not make any edits on the statements written between these two signs, including this warning text. Do not use these signs. Absence of this warning text as the initial statement or an uncompatible statment between the signs will be considered as corruption. Corruptions may not be automatically recovered, and result in loss of the configuration data, unless recovered by the user.<<

Here's the deal. Programme searches for the statement-introducing-signs (the double greater-than sign), reads whatever, until it reaches the outro. It really will look for the warning text, word by word, so do not touch it. Haha, just kidding!.. It actually looks for it character by character... Having a statement before the warning text is also not allowed, even if the statement is all correct. Text outside the intro and outro are disregarded, so... yeah. Ok, I truly am done with the warnings now.

=== How to read ===
- The first value, right after the intro sign, is the Gamepad Index (0~3). Tell me if you wish this programme supported more controllers, it only supports one right now.
- The second value is the Controller Button Index (0~23). Not necessarily just buttons, stick directionals are also there, whatever...
- The last one is the Keyboard Key ID (0~255) for the buttons to be translated into. IDs are given in hexadecimal.

=== Button Indexes ===
00: A button		01: B button		02: X button		03: Y button		04: R bumper		05: L bumper		06: R trigger		07: L trigger		08: D up		09: D down		10: D left		11: D right		12: start button		13: back button		14: L stk press		15: R stk press		16: L stk up		17: L stk down		18: L stk right		19: L stk left		20: R stk up		21: R stk down		22: R stk right		23: R stk left		

=== Keyboard Key IDs ===
Here's a list from Microsoft Developer Network: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
Note: I have prevented some keys to be mapped during the assignment inside the programme. I recommend you not to try some random virtual key ID from there, but whatever... When ID is zero, the corresponding button won't get translated into anything.
