This is a console application I have developed during 2014's winter break,
which was before I began studying in the computer engineering department.
It is a very lightweight, very simple keyboard mapper for Xbox 360 controller.

## Usage

You are encouraged to examine and compile the source code for yourself.
For your convenience, I also have added the built executable to the repository.

## Features

The mapper supports the joystick movements for both left and right joysticks.
The interaction has been engineered to work smoothly and as expected.

Configuraiton of the mapping is recommended to be done through the console application.
Specification of which controller control during the configuration can both be done
through keyboard, or by pressing the controller control itself.
